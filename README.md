// Import the zlacpy module
const zlacpy = require('zlacpy');

// Define your matrices A and B
let A = [
  [1, 2],
  [3, 4]
];

let B = [
  [0, 0],
  [0, 0]
];

// Call the zlacpy function to copy matrix A to matrix B
zlacpy(A, B);

// B will now be a copy of A
console.log(B);
```

This simple code snippet demonstrates how you can use the `zlacpy` function to copy a matrix in your JavaScript application.
